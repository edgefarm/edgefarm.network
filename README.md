# About The Project

Dealing with unreliable networks is not easy and has been solved many times, but at the application level.

With *edgefarm.network* a solution is available that encapsulates the problem and relieves the application developer. The application developer is offered an API that can be utilized to send the data. *edgefarm.network* then takes care that the data is transferred reliably.

*edgefarm.network* uses the open source project nats under the hood for this, a swiss army knife for messaging.

## Features

 - Isolated messaging networks
 - User defined buffer sizes and data retention
 - Dapr-based convenience layer for easy access
 - Secure access from third-party systems

# Getting Started
