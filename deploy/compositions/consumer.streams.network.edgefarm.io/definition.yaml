                              for more information on queue groups. This is a push

                              relies on the server and client exchanging messages
                              to regulate when and how many messages are pushed to
                              the client. This one-to-one flow control mechanism works
                              in tandem with the one-to-many flow control imposed
                              by MaxAckPending across all subscriptions bound to a

                              there is no activity on the stream. The message status
                              header will have a code of 100. Unlike FlowControl,
                              it will have no reply to address. It may have a description
                              such "Idle Heartbeat". Note that this heartbeat mechanism
                              is all handled transparently by supported clients and
